# Dockerize
Docker Compose setup to run multiple app service

## Overview

Built in latest lumen 8, with fast and extensible services

It exposes services:

* web (nginx:1.19-alpine)
* php (hermsi/alpine-fpm-php:7.4)
	* composer
	* npm (nodejs:12) [optional]
	* openjdk11 [optional]
* db (postgres:11.1-alpine)
* cache (redis:6.2-alpine)

## Install prerequisites

For now the project has been tested on Linux only but should run fine on Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac.

You will need:

* [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) (optional)
* [Dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) (optional)

## How to use it

### Starting App with stack

Checkout the repository or download the sources.

Before start, be sure to copy .env.example to .env on the root directory

Simply run `./stack start` and you are done.

The app will be available on `localhost` serving /app/default/public directory and PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432`


### Using Stack

Some of stack shortcut instead of using docker-compose. Be sure to add this script to executable mode `chmod +x stack`

	- `./stack build`
		Build only php module

	- `./stack start`
		Start the service

	- `./stack stop`
		Stop the service

	- `./stack <workdir> composer <cmd>`
		Simple shortcut to execute composer

	- `./stack <workdir> artisan <cmd>`
		Simple shortcut to execute artisan

	- `./stack <workdir> npm <cmd>`
		Simple shortcut to execute node module

	- `./stack <workdir> sh`
		Run inside docker-compose interactively

	- `./stack <cmd>`
		Shortcut for docker compose exec


### Api Test

Try all available API function with `localhost`



### Starting Docker Compose

Checkout the repository or download the sources.

Simply run `docker-compose up` or with -d to run as daemon service then you are done.

Nginx will be available on `localhost` and PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432`.


### Using PostgreSQL

Default connection:

`docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres`

Using .env file default parameters:

`docker-compose exec db psql -U dbuser dbname`

If you want to connect to the DB from another container (from the `php` one for instance), the host will be the service name: `db`.


### Using PHP

You can execute any command on the `php` container as you would do on any docker-compose container:

`docker-compose exec php php -v`


### Using Nodejs

You can execute any command on the `npm` container as you would do on any docker-compose container:

`docker-compose exec php npm -v`


### Configurations

By default `localhost` will serve public directory at `/app/default`
Every folder inside `/app` directory can be reached by wildcard domain `folder.test` such as `default.test` for default directory.

Must have dnsmasq installed
`/etc/dnsmasq.conf

address=/test/127.0.0.1
server=8.8.8.8
